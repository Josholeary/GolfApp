# Golf Score Tracker Web Application by Josh O'Leary
## About
This web app built using the python 'flask' web framework acts as a group scorecard for users while playing golf. It allows multiple users to join a session to track their score on each hole. It will then actively update a live leaderboard for the whole course showing all users in the session the scores in a table.

## The original idea
While out playing golf in a large group I realised that often we would seperate into smaller groups and progress through the course at different times leading to everyone playing on different holes. When this occurred you couldn't find out everyone elses scores until the end to determine the winner and every group had a different physical scorecard. I thought what if you could host all the scores online where one person sets up a session and everyone fills out their score as they play. This would not only act as a way to track scores as you played but would also let you see how everyone else on the course was getting on in real time.
