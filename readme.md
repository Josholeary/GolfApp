# Golf Score Tracker Web Application by Josh O'Leary
## About
This web app built using the python 'flask' web framework acts as a group scorecard for users while playing golf. It allows multiple users to join a session to track their score on each hole. It will then actively update a live leaderboard for the whole course showing all users in the session the scores in a table.

## To Do:
- Add user sessions for simpler score entry
- Improve frontend UI
- Add stricter user validations
- Allow for more game sessions to be played at once
